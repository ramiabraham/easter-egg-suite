Displays easter egg style content when codes are entered.

Current Codes:
Konami - Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A
Mortal Kombat Blood - A, B, A, C, A, B, B


For the future (maybe):

*Change more content with success code entry

*Allow users to enable/disable specific codes

*Allow users to add their own codes and responses
